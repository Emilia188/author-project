                <h4>The Final Empire</h4>
                <p>
                  The first book in Mistborn series, is a gripping and inventive
                  fantasy that introduces a unique magic system based on metal
                  consumption. With its thrilling heist plot, richly crafted
                  world, and themes of rebellion and trust, it offers a fresh
                  take on the traditional "chosen one" trope, while also
                  delivering deep character arcs and an unpredictable, engaging
                  story.

                  Words of Radiance is a brilliant continuation of The
